# Industry Mapping Enhancement for 9-Category Framework
## Preserving Workflow-Based Structure While Adding Industry Customization

### Overview

This document enhances our established 9-category workflow-based framework by mapping specific industries to each category while maintaining the core user experience benefits. This approach preserves our research-backed structure while adding industry-specific value.

### Core Principle

**Workflow-First, Industry-Enhanced**: Users still navigate by what they want to accomplish (workflow), but can filter and customize based on their industry context.
